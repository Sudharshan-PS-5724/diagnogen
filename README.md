# Heart Disease Prediction and Classification System

This multi-page Streamlit application is a comprehensive system for heart disease prediction, patient management, and hospital alerts. Designed with functionality for users, hospitals, and an admin panel, the application facilitates a streamlined checkup flow with machine learning predictions, ECG image analysis, and chatbot support for patient queries.

## Features

### User Side
- **Login/Signup:** Users can create an account, log in, and securely access their records.
- **Checkup & Prediction:** Users can perform a heart disease checkup by entering medical data. Predictions are generated by a heart disease prediction model.
- **ECG Image Analysis:** If a heart disease risk is detected, users can upload an ECG image, which is analyzed by deep learning models.
- **Hospital Finder:** For users with detected heart conditions, the nearest hospital is found based on an A* search algorithm that considers both distance and traffic.
- **Chatbot Support:** A specialized chatbot answers heart-related questions and offers guidance on heart health.
- **Report History:** Users can view a history of their reports, including predictions and hospital visits.

### Hospital Side
- **Registration & Login:** Hospitals can register and manage their profile.
- **Patient Alerts:** Hospitals receive alerts when a patient nearby is flagged for immediate care.

### Admin Side
- **User & Hospital Management:** Admins have full CRUD functionality for managing users and hospitals.
- **Overview & Analytics:** Admins can view system usage statistics, patient activity, and model performance metrics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Packages: `Streamlit`, `MongoDB`, `bcrypt`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction-system.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the Database**
   - Create and initialize `database.db` for users, hospitals, and admin data.
   - Run the provided database setup script if available, or use `sqlite3` commands to create tables.

4. **Pre-trained Models**
   - Place your trained heart disease and ECG models in the `models/` directory. For example:
     ```plaintext
     models/
     ├── heart_disease_model.pkl
     └── ecg_model.pkl
     ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Admin Account Setup**
   - The initial admin account can be set up directly in the database or using an admin setup form.

## Usage

1. **User Login/Signup:** Users sign up with personal details, log in, and access their dashboard.
2. **Heart Disease Checkup:** Enter symptoms and lifestyle information for disease prediction.
3. **ECG Analysis (If Required):** Upload an ECG image for further analysis if a risk is detected.
4. **Hospital Alerts:** Nearest hospitals are notified based on the prediction results.
5. **Admin and Hospital Functionalities:** Admin can manage users and hospitals, while hospitals can update information and receive alerts.

## Code Standards and Design Patterns

The application follows several coding standards to ensure readability, modularity, and scalability:
- **Modular Code Structure:** Separate modules for authentication, data processing, and hospital finding.
- **Database Management:** Uses SQLite for lightweight data storage.
- **Descriptive Naming Conventions:** Variables and functions are named descriptively for ease of understanding.
- **Streamlit for UI:** All user inputs, file uploads, and navigation are handled using Streamlit widgets for a smooth, interactive experience.
- **Security Considerations:** User passwords are hashed using `bcrypt`, and sensitive data handling follows best practices.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Chatbot Functionality:** More advanced AI-driven chatbot with natural language processing for better user interaction.
- **Integration with Real-time Traffic Data:** Use of real-time APIs for more accurate hospital distance and traffic data.
- **Advanced Analytics for Admins:** Enhanced dashboards for visualizing usage data, health trends, and prediction accuracy.
